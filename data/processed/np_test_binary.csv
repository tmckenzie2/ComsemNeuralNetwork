"Just a small hospital, not covering all majors.",,,1
"This is another advantage of large cities, which is small town does not have.",,,1
I think education in small town better than big town.,,,1
College or university are only in the big cities.,,,1
"In my city, it has two universities, and maybe three or four college.",,,1
"We have college, too.",,,1
I live like Spokane.,,,1
The people who live in small town have good relationship each other.,,,1
"But big city, the main housing is apartment, so people don't know who is my neighbor.",,,1
Maybe I have different story.,,,1
"I am going to take my lunch, and after that, I'm going to sleep for three, five hours.",,,1

They gave him an small piece of soap and a dirty towel.and a very poorly service.,,,1
"They said, ""Hodja, why you just gave us just copper coin?""",,,1

We don't know the rules in United State.,,,1
That was same guy.,,,1
And give other person wrong information.,,,1
"For example, girl told me I need your phone, I won't.",,,1
The other man thought he is girl.,,,1
I think many students do that things.,,,1
"He was in this room, and he was in other room.",,,1
"The king's chef made a very taste dish, which was made by vegetables and eggs and some butter.",,,1
Hodja friends got shocked.,,,1
A stranger man came to Hodja.,,,1
That's all--story ended.,,,1
"Hodja met his neighbor, and neighbor asked him, ""What were you doing last night?""",,,1
"And neighborhood ask, ""But the sound is so loud! What were you doing?""",,,1
"After few days, he returned it with small pot, so that his neighbor, who got a two pots, said ""What happened, Hodja?""",,,1
"Next time, Hodja borrowed a large pot again, from the same neighbor.",,,1
Pot cannot die!,,,1
