The World Cup is tournament.,,,1
Not in Middle East?,,,1
The last competition was Italy winner.,,,1
I don't have favorite team.,,,1

"She saw one of the sister in the hallway, and she was cripple.",,,1
"This time, we talk about our topic, car accident.",,,1
All the members had different experience.,,,1
The third thing is about good driver.,,,1
First one is that drifting is dangerous.,,,1
"Also, we talked about different situation in each country.",,,1
"Also, we talked about the reason for car accident.",,,1
We didn't talk about car accident a lot.,,,1
Our group members thought that drifting is dangerous thing.,,,1
Second thing is traffic situation in each country.,,,1
"In each country, there is certain rule, but most people don't obey it.",,,1

Before go to university.,,,1
"They are teenager, so they don't want to do that.",,,1
"When he get old, now he has family, now he's behaving well.",,,1
And I think another good things is to choose the kinds of friends.,,,1
"For example, if your friend smokes cigarette, you will smoke.",,,1
"""You are not smoker.""",,,1
They will act their lives the same they learned to act in home.,,,1
Many of teenagers they didn't respect to older people.,,,1
Teenagers' most biggest problem is smoking.,,,1
the adult which teenagers sometimes treat in bad way,,,1
Other connection with Sr. Rosaria's group is regarding imitation of the mass media values.,,,1
Other reason could be parents are lazy of punish their children.,,,1
It's like a time to new experiences.,,,1
We listened experience of all the team members except Sr. Gabrielle.,,,1
"When you get to certain age, it's a transition age.",,,1

"Around ten years, she works not only in Gonzaga's university, but also in Whitworth University.",,,1
It's completely other thing.,,,1
It's a full round 40 years woman who is married and has children.,,,1
Sister Gabrielle's conversation partner was one of sister in your house.,,,1
"One day, two lady dress in black robes, one of the lady asked them what is your name?",,,1
"He has met her only once, and short time.",,,1
His origin country is from Lebanon.,,,1

The diagnosis was that she had problem in her knee.,,,1
"Ligament, or something that has to do a surgery there.",,,1
"If you want to be doctor, you should study till you die.",,,1
You only get your doctor license before two years.,,,1
I think they require much qualification.,,,1
I think this reason is more affect that doctor has confidence.,,,1
Then he decided try to do surgeries which are more than his ability.,,,1
"When I was young, one women has been died because of medical mistake.",,,1
There are picture of the died woman.,,,1
And it depend on the nurse education.,,,1
When the doctor is making a surgery--,,,1
You find a doctors who just graduated from the medical school.,,,1
He do surgeries in the brain.,,,1
I think I don't have the right of talking about their experience.,,,1
Medical mistakes happens.,,,1

It was very funny situation.,,,1
"Who is paying, man or woman?",,,1
I want talk about dowry.,,,1
Some - especially families that are well-educated - they don't ask too high dowry.,,,1

"In my country, if the girl - his father is a judge, he can make the children get married don't have to pay the dowry.",,,1
"In Saudi Arabia, the dowry is religion.",,,1
"So, for example, when you has two or three daughter, the man pay for you money?",,,1
