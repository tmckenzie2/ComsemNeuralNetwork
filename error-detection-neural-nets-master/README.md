# error-detection-neural-nets
# NPtrain and NPtest are testing only for NP errors.
# verb test contains only subject verb agreement errors and checks how accurate the net is at finding them.
# combine test and train sets contain np and subject verb errors. 
# to use the combine sets you need to change the the Dense function and num_classes variable to reflect the number of categories.
